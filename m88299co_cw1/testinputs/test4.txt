Hi Bijan and Sandra,

My name is Chijioke Onukem and my student ID is 10423224.

Am doing COMP61511 (Software Engineering Concepts in Practice). 

I understand that the deadline for submitting the Course Work One (CW1) is 4th October, 2018 by 7 PM, however i may not be able to finish up by that time due to reasons like:

Am very new to python and its taking me plenty time to assimilate some concepts and problem solving. 

I will be glad if i can get an extra 48 hours for submission. 

Hope to hear from you soon. Thanks
